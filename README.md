# Fossil Ferns
A revised list of fern fossils for (fossil-based) molecular dating

This version of the calibration dataset is FernCal v1.0. 
It includes 114 fossil specimes for fossil-calibrated molecular dating of ferns. This dataset was ompiled for the following paper:

- Nitta JH, Schuettpelz E, Ram√≠rez-Barahona S, Iwasaki W. An open and continuously updated fern tree of life (FTOL)

Each fossil is given a unique identifier (NFos).
- In order to make these fossils calibration traceable, we encourage users to mention this identifier explicitly in publications.

The main aim of constructing this fossil calibration list is to have an open resource that can be continually updated based on community-feedback. 
We encourage users to propose additions to the list or changes to the taxonomic assignment of particular fossils. 
Our philosophy is to only include fossils when the original publication is available to us, so the addition of new fossils is contingent on users providing the full reference to the original publication where the material is described.
For transparency and to keep track of calibration history, if a taxonomic change is warranted a note on the propose changes will be added while keeping the original. 
Deletions to the fossil list are not considered, but in particular cases a note of caution will be appended.
