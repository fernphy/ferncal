# FernCal: a revised list of fern fossils for (fossil-based) molecular dating of the fern tree of life  
This version of the calibration dataset is FernCal v1.0.  
It includes fossil specimens for fossil-calibrated molecular dating of ferns.     
This dataset was originally compiled for the following paper:  
- Nitta JH, Schuettpelz E, Ram√≠rez-Barahona S, Iwasaki W. An open and continuously updated fern tree of life (FTOL)

## Phylosophy
The main aim of constructing this fossil calibration list is to have an open resource that can be continually updated based on community-feedback. We encourage users to propose additions to the list or changes to the taxonomic assignment of particular fossils.  
The general philosophy behind this list is to include fossils whose metadata are available (e.g., the original publication, locality, specimen numbers), thus providing the opportunity to re-assess the fossil and its taxonomic affinitites based on updated taxonomic knowledge. Thus, fossil-calibration of molecular trees using our list of fossils has several advantages:
- Calibration points based on individual specimens, which are useful for FBD-type dating.
- Continuous update of the list (e.g., corrections or additions).
- Re-assessment of taxonomic affinities based on current knowledge.

## Note to users
- Each fossil has a unique identifier (NFos). In order to keep track of fossils calibrations (both here and in publications), we strongly encourage users to mention fossils using this identifier.  
- The addition of new fossils is contingent on users providing the full reference (i.e., .bib) to the original publication where the material is described.  
- To keep track of the history of use of these fossils, if a taxonomic change is needed (e.g., change in generic circumscription) a note on the proposed change will be added while keeping track of the original taxonomic assignment.  
- Deletions to fossil list will not be considered, but in particular cases a note of caution will be appended.   

NOTE: the list is in (continuous) development. Thus, at any given time fossil's metadata might be missing.
